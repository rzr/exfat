= Prerequisites =

If there are no binary packages for your OS or you want to get the most recent version, you should compile from source. To do this under GNU/Linux you need to install the following packages:
  * `subversion` (if you wish to get the source from the repository, see below),
  * `scons`,
  * `fuse-devel` (or `fuse-dev`),
  * `gcc`.
Under Mac OS X you need to install:
  * XCode (can be found on a Mac OS X installation DVD shipped with your Mac, includes `subversion`),
  * [http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/downloads MacFUSE],
  * [http://www.scons.org/ scons].

= Getting the Source =

Download tarball with source from the [http://code.google.com/p/exfat/downloads/list Downloads] section or directly from the repository:
{{{
svn co http://exfat.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ exfat-read-only
}}}

= Compiling =

Change directory and compile:
{{{
cd exfat-read-only
scons
}}}
Then install the driver:
{{{
sudo scons install
}}}

= Mounting =

Mount you exFAT volume from root (`/dev/sdXn` is the volume special file, `/mnt/exfat` is a mountpoint):
{{{
sudo mount.exfat-fuse /dev/sdXn /mnt/exfat
}}}
Under Mac OS X you should specify `umask=0` option to permit write access for non-root user:
{{{
sudo mount.exfat-fuse /dev/sdXn /mnt/exfat -o umask=0
}}}
