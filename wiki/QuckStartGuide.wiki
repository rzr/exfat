= Prerequisites =

If there are no binary packages for your OS or you want to get the most recent version, you should compile from source. To do this under GNU/Linux you need to install the following packages:
  * `subversion` (if you wish to get the source from the repository, see below),
  * `scons`,
  * `fuse-devel` (or `fuse-dev`),
  * `gcc`.

= Getting the Source =

Download tarball with source from the [http://code.google.com/p/exfat/downloads/list Downloads] section or directly from the repository:
{{{
svn co http://exfat.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ exfat-read-only
}}}

= Compiling =

Change directory and compile:
{{{
cd exfat-read-only
scons
}}}
Then install the driver:
{{{
sudo scons install
}}}

= Mounting =

You need util-linux-ng 2.18 or later to mount exFAT volumes automatically. Anyway, you can mount manually (you'll need root privileges):
{{{
sudo mount.exfat-fuse /dev/sdXn /mnt/exfat
}}}
where `/dev/sdXn` is the volume special file, `/mnt/exfat` is a mountpoint.
