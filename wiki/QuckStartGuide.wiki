= Prerequisites =

Currently there are no binary packages here, so you should compile this driver from source. To do this you need to install the following packages:
  * `subversion`,
  * `scons`,
  * `fuse-devel` (or `fuse-dev`),
  * `gcc`.

= Getting the source =

Download the source from repository:
{{{
svn co http://exfat.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ exfat-read-only
}}}

= Compiling =

Change directory and compile:
{{{
cd exfat-read-only
scons
}}}
Then install the driver:
{{{
sudo scons install
}}}

= Mounting =

Mount you exFAT volume from root (`/dev/sdXn` is the volume special file, `/mnt/exfat` is a mountpoint):
{{{
sudo mount -t exfat-fuse /dev/sdXn /mnt/exfat
}}}
Under Mac OS X you should specify `umask=0` option to permit write access for non-root user:
{{{
sudo mount -t exfat-fuse /dev/sdXn /mnt/exfat -o umask=0
}}}
